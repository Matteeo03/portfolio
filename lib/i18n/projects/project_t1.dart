Newtonian Noise Monitoring for Gravitational Wave Detectors

Distributed sensor network monitoring environmental noise at gravitational wave detector sites across three international research sites.

PROBLEM
Newtonian Noise - seismic vibrations and low-frequency acoustic pressure variations - limits the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors like Virgo and the planned Einstein Telescope. Understanding and characterizing this environmental noise is critical for improving detector performance and enabling the detection of weaker gravitational wave signals from distant cosmic events.

SOLUTION
As part of the research team led by Dr. Mariusz Suchenek at AstroCeNT (Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center, Polish Academy of Sciences), I contributed to the development and deployment of seismic and infrasound sensors designed at the institute. My responsibilities included assembling custom PCB boards designed by the research group, testing sensor prototypes in laboratory conditions, and participating in field installations. The network consists of precision seismic sensors monitoring ground vibrations and infrasound microphones measuring low-frequency pressure changes. In total we installed over 100 pairs of sensors. I traveled to international research facilities to assist in sensor deployment and system integration, gaining experience in multinational scientific collaborations.

Infrasound microphones - key specifications
- Frequency range: 0.1-120 Hz
- Sensitivity: 2.5 mV/Pa
- Distortion: < 1.5 dB
- Unit cost: ~100 EUR 

Seismometers - key specifications
- Dynamic range: 134 dB
- Timing accuracy: < 20 µs
- Sampling rate: from 0.5 ms

RESULTS
Sensor networks successfully deployed and operational at three critical sites: Virgo EGO gravitational wave detector (Cascina, Italy), Sos Enattos underground research facility (Sardinia, Italy), and ET Path Finder technology development lab (Maastricht, Netherlands). Data collected from these installations is currently being analyzed by research teams to develop noise cancellation strategies for next-generation detectors. Patent applications have been filed for the sensor technology developed by the group.

My role: Technical specialist and PhD researcher - PCB assembly, sensor prototype testing, field installations at international sites, technical support for multinational collaborations.
